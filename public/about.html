<h1>About Me</h1>

I’m Ernest, a web designer with a strong interest in creating clean, user-focused, and visually engaging websites. <br />
 I enjoy transforming ideas into functional designs that balance aesthetics with usability.  <br />

  Through personal and academic projects, I’ve developed skills in layout design, responsive design, and <br />
modern web technologies, and I’m continually working to refine my craft. I value clear communication,<br />
 attention to detail, and thoughtful design decisions in every project I create.v
